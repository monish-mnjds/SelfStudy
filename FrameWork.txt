My framework is POM, it is data driven and i have used pytest.

I have maintained one folder for test cases, one for automating pages, dataset,
generating reports, screenshots......

In pages, I have a pom module, to run the automation scripts 
I have created one more folder called Tests,
in which I have integrated pytest 
using that I use to run these test cases....

and I have used fixtures in my test case and parameterize markers....

In order to launch and close the browser, we have used fixtures.....

for each and every test cases or modules I have created separate class 
In order to run the class continuously......we have used fixtures.....

In order to pass the test data we have used paramaterize......

In oops concept, I have used Inheritance in my program....
if i import that it will not inherit the fixture rather it will inherit only the method 
so i inheriting the class itself......

we are maintain object data and test data in a separate package and those things are
in excel sheet and we are driving the data into the test scripts...
and we are reading it using xlrd......this is the overview.....

how do you do synchronization ....

there are two types conditional and unconditional 
time.sleep is unconditional
implicitly and explicitly are conditional

implicitly_wait is applied for every driverInstance
