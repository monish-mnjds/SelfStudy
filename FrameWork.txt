My framework is POM, it is data driven and i have used pytest.

I have maintained several packages in my framework folder 
namely Test, Library, Data, Pages......

In pages, I have a pom module, to run the automation scripts 
In Tests, I have integrated pytest in my script using that I use to run these test cases....

I have maintained object data and test data in a separate package called Data 
and those things are in excel sheet and we are driving the data into the test scripts...
and we are reading it using xlrd......

and the others packages is for generating reports, screenshots......

I have used fixtures and parameterize markers in my test case ....

In order to launch and close the browser 
and to run the class in every modules continuously...... I have used fixtures.....

To pass the test data, I have used paramaterized markers......

In oops concept, I have used Inheritance in my program....

Note:     if I import that it will not inherit the fixture rather it will inherit only the method 
-----     so I am inheriting the class itself......

this is the overview.....

how do you do synchronization ....
-----------------------------------

there are two types conditional and unconditional 

time.sleep is unconditional

implicitly_wait and explicitly(webdriver wait) are conditional

implicitly_wait is applied for every driverInstance..........
