lines after yield keyword will be executed, but after return keyword, the lines will not be executed......

What are Generators ?
----------------------

1. Generators are functions that return traversable objects (or) items.

2. This function do not produce all the items at once.

3. Rather, They produce one at a time and only when required.

4. Runs along with 'for' loops

5. Without Generators producing iterables is difficult and lengthy.


Advantages of Generators:
-------------------------

1. it implements __iter__(), __next__() and StopIteration automatically.

2. Better memory management & utilization.

3. can be used to produce infinite items.


Diff Between Generator functions and Normal Functions ???
---------------------------------------------------------

1) Make Use of 'yield' keyword                                1) Make use of 'return' keyword

2)Run when 'next()' method is called                          2) run when name of the method is called

3) produce items one at a time & only when required           3) produce all items at once.



use of 'For' loop in generators:
--------------------------------

To execute the generator function at once, you can use 'for loop'.

This loop iterates over all the objects and after all implementations, it executes StopIteration.
