polymorphism refers to the ability of a method to process objects differently depending on their data type or class.

Polymorphism in Python programs can be achieved by defining two or more methods with the same name inside two or more classes.

it provides flexibility, using which a code can be extended and easily maintained over time.

Method overriding
------------------

In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.
In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. However, it is possible to modify a method in
a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited
from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class. In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class.
This process of re-implementing a method in the child class is known as Method Overriding.

Method Overloading, a way to create multiple methods with the same name but different arguments.
